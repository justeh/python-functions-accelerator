# Python Accelerator - Function Buildpacks for Knative (v1.0)

This accelerator generates template files, which enable developers to work with Function Buildpacks
and deploy a FaaS experience easily.

These template files are generated from VMware's open-source [Function Buildpacks for Knative](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/function-buildpacks-for-knative) project. 

## Getting Started

To begin editing your function, refer to the tree diagram below of the file to modify:
```
functions-python
    └── func.py // EDIT THIS FILE
```

Inside this file, you will find a function that is invoked by default. For example:
```
def main(data: Any, attributes: dict):
    # Your function implementation goes here
    return attributes, "Hello world!"
```

You may replace the code inside this default function with your logic.

To see samples of code deployable as a Function (FaaS) experience, visit the [samples folder](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/function-buildpacks-for-knative/tree/main/samples/python).
## Deploying
Please see [DEPLOYING.md](DEPLOYING.md) on how to build, deploy, and test your newly built function.
